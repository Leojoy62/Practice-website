            <h3>Web Developer</h3>
            <p>
                Web developers design and build websites. They are typically responsible for the appearance, of the site
                and
                technical aspects, such as site speed and how much traffic the site can handle. Web developers may also
                create
                site content that requires technical features.</p>

                <p>A web developer is responsible for programming the code that “tells” a website how to function. A
                    developer builds a website from the bottom up, which means designing it in such a way that end users
                    have no difficulty navigating the site.Large-scale web projects often divide these tasks among
                    multiple web developers.</p>
